<h2>Android Sensors Overview</h2> 

<p1>In this page, I go over three useful sites to learn about mobile sensors and their capabilities. I have listed three websites that were useful to me , so I can reference back. I have also gave them a rating out of 5, to show how useful they are compared to the other sites I posted on here. </p1> <br /> <br />

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxC1KCoGbIM">YouTube -What Sensors Are in A Smartphone?</a><br /> <br />
In this YouTube Video, they go over the most important and most used sensors on your smartphone. The guy does a good job explaining what each sensor does and is used for. I found it very usefule when he breaks it down in categories. It helped me choose the right one for what kind ofnapp I wanted to create.<br /> <br />
